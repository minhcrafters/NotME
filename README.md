# NotME

## This bot is no longer actively maintained as I no longer have interest in coding Discord bots and I was basically a script kiddie at the time.

Yet another generic, multi-purpose Discord bot.

# Installation and Setup
1. `npm i`
2. Rename `config.sample.js` to `config.js` and customize the file.
2. `npm start`
